SERVER IS NOT APPROACHABLE!!!

Ping the server hostname and ip address
*hostname is pingable ( the issue might be on client side as server is pingable)
*hostname is not pingable but ip is pingable(could be DNS issue)
*hostname and ip both are not pingable
Check the other other server on its same network to see if there is network side access issue or overall something is bad.
 False: Issue is not overall network side but its with that host/server 
 True: Might be overall netwrok issue

Check if server has the ip, and has up status of the network interface
Ping the gateway, also check the routes
Check firewall
Check physical cable connection
